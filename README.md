# ON-CHAIN RISK ANALYSER




## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Analyzing credit worthiness of the customer.
- Analyzing the risk involved in policy issuance to the customer.
- High volume of data has to be obtained to perform above two analysis.

## ZERO KNOWLEDGE MACHINE LEARNING
With Zero Knowledge Machine Learning the party that
computes the inference can prove things like:  
“I ran X input on Y model to generate Z output”
## AI ORACLE ARCHITECTURE
